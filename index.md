<p>Nowadays, I am working on my Masters thesis titled "Machine Learning for Autonomous Vehicles", in which I am investigating the utility of complex-natured radar data for object detection in the context of autonomous vehicles. The Master Thesis is a part of a larger EPSRC/Jaguar Land Rover funded programme.</p>
<p>Currently, I am looking for a full-time research opportunity as well. Feel free to contact me.</p>
