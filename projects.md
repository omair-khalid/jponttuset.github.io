<h1>Target Tracking Algorithms - Comparison and Implementation</h1>
Explored and implemented in detail the solutions of (single/multiple) target-tracking problems under the Bayesian framework, and demonstrated the workings of Kalman filters, EKF, Gaussian Filter, PHD Filter, and Particle Filter through simulations.

<h1>Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Calibration</h1>
Having only sub-Nyquist sampled data, three tasks were tackled using non-convex optimization techniques: Construction of MR images with known coil sensitivities, Calibration of MR coil sensitivities with known MR Images, blind deconvolution problem of construction of MR images and calibration of coil sensitivities without known coil sensitivities and MR images.


<h1>Design of Mission Control Strategy for Autonomous Exploration</h1>
A Frontier-based exploration strategy was employed to efficiently explore a static, unknown map,  within a given duration while avoiding obstacles, and return to home afterwards. Potential Field path planning was utilized in the low level controller. Turtlebot in  ROS framework was used. 


<h1>Breast Density Classification based on Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) Scans</h1> 
An exploration into which features and machine learning algorithms suit the task of classification of breast densities (BIRAD 1-4) in DBT images. Utilizing HOG and Texture features, Support Vector Machines (SVM) were utilized for the task, achieving 87.5\% test accuracy. 

<h1>Object Classification using Bag of Words approach</h1>
This project followed Pascal Visual Object Classification challenge 2006; 10 classes were required to be classified using suitable feature extraction and Machine Learning technique of choice. The chosen implementation used Alexnet for feature extraction incorporating Bag-of-Words dimensionality reduction, and SVM as classifier to produce 92.10\% AUC on test data.

<h1>textbf{Design and Implementation of Low Cost Automated 3D Scanning System</h1>
Researched and implemented Surface Reconstruction Algorithms within the larger group project of designing a complete 3D scanning software involving Microsoft Kinect. Point Cloud Library(PCL) was leveraged for acquisition and processing of data; Code in C++. 

<h1>Facial Recognition using Principal Component Analysis</h1>
Involved a normalization step to account for variation in scale, orientation and location of the face in the input images, followed by the use of Principal Component Analysis to extract top-\textit{k} principal components/eigen-faces to represent the dataset. Test images were predicted using the nearest neighbour (NN) method based on Euclidean distance. An accuracy of 71.1\% was achieved on the given dataset.
